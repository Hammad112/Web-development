## HTML
Hyper-Text-Markup-Language (aka HTML) is a markup language that is used to define the basic structure of any website. The basic structure consists of the header, body (main content), and footer of the website. And, what is a markup language? Any language that is understood by the browser and which tells the browser how to render the data is known as a markup language. 

## CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is a style sheet language used to style the markup language like HTML. If we consider HTML as the skeleton structure of the body, then CSS is the skin/overall look that covers it. CSS allows you to handle multiple web pages using only one CSS file. CSS facilitates you to modify various properties of HTML elements like you can modify background color/image, alignment to tags using margin, position properties, can provide different font properties(font-family, font-size, color, etc), or you also can remove existing properties of HTML tags (like you can convert block elements to inline).
